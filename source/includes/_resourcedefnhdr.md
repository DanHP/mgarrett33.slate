## Resource Definitions

Each resource in the API has a "type" that defines its properties.  See the Redfish specification for `@odata.type` for details.

This section defines the supported types and lists the typical instances of each.  Because this API document is applicable to all HPE servers using iLO 4, you may find variations such as:

* properties implemented on one type of server and not another
* resources that are read only on one type of server and not another
* The number of resources of a particular type (e.g. multiple compute nodes or enclosing chassis)
